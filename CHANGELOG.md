# Changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.0.12

- Add tool-qualified package selectors such as `[tool.uv.package.glob]` and package-only
  `max-major` ceilings.
- Respect explicit manifest `<`/`<=` upper bounds during major upgrades; `--rewrite` is the
  deliberate escape hatch for crossing and rewriting them.
- Report declared-bound and `max-major` holds in terminal and JSON output.
- Reject `exclude-folders` and `exclude-packages` under package, registry, and project selectors.
  Earlier versions accepted these misplaced keys but silently ignored them; exclusion lists belong
  under `[tool.*]`, `[global]`, or a command table.
